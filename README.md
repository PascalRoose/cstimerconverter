# Cube Timer Converter
## Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. 

To install Python I recommend you to following the tutorial on https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/

## Usage
If you have Python 3.6 installed as default you can execute the program using the `python` command. 
Otherwise you'll have to use the `python3` command. For the examples I'll be using the `python3` command.

Python expects 3 arguments for the script to run:
- Script name, in our case: cstimerconverter.py
- Input file
- Output file

The location of the input and output file arguments are always relative from the script location.

For example: if you have your input file named input.txt in the same directory as the script and 
you wanna convert and save it as output.txt (in the same directory). You'll then execute the following:
```
python3 input.txt output.txt
```
